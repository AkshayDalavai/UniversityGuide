# UniversityGuide

# Introduction: 

After getting admints from various Universities, we have noticed that students struggle to decide the college based on their admits only and also the information which a student gathers from various sources could not be entirely valid. By developing this application, we plan to provide a platform to prospective students of Syracuse University where they can post their queries regarding the University and get answers from verified students who are already studying here. Other than that, for the current and alumni students we want to provide a platform where they can discuss various topics ranging from sports to jobs.

# Application Idea:

Our application would mainly consists of four modules such as :
1.	SU Forum, where the new aspirants can post their queries and will be able to get the information about the courses, professors etc.  
2.	SU Housing, where the new aspirants will get the valid information regarding off-campus housing options, locality, restaurants, grocery shops and also provide a platform for students to rent a reliable short-term accommodation.
3.	SU Sports, gives the latest articles on the Syracuse Sports such as football and Soccer, etc .
4.	SU Marketplace, which will help university student/faculty/staff to buy/sell/exchange products.
