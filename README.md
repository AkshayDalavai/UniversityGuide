# Introduction: 

After getting admitted into various Universities, we have noticed that students struggle to decide the college based on their admits only and also the information which a student gathers from various sources could not be entirely valid. By developing this application, we plan to provide a platform to prospective students of Syracuse University where they can post their queries regarding the University and get answers from verified students who are already studying here. Other than that, for the current and alumni students we want to provide a platform where they can discuss various topics ranging from sports to jobs. One can be assured that the answers which they get are from genuine students from the university as we plan to verify the user’s students by allowing them to sign up only using the University’s email.

# Application Idea:

Our application would mainly consists of four modules such as :
1.	SU Forum, where the new aspirants can post their queries and will be able to get the information about the courses, professors etc.  
2.	SU Housing, where the new aspirants will get the valid information regarding off-campus housing options, locality, restaurants, grocery shops and also provide a platform for students to rent a reliable short-term accommodation.
3.	SU sports, gives the latest articles on the Syracuse Sports such as football and Soccer, etc .
4.	SU Marketplace, which will help university student/faculty/staff to buy/sell/exchange products.

# Why is this a killer app idea:

Current information obtained from other internet-based sources do not vouch for the genuinely of the information. This is overcome by our application as we plan to verify both the information seekers and providers. Also, we allow the students to ask questions and comment anonymously which could help many users get genuine answers to the questions. The discussions within the forums will be moderated so that the topics abide by the rules of the forums. These unique features which we plan to develop make this application a killer idea.

# Target Audience:

Our target audience are graduate and undergraduate students who want to pursue their education at Syracuse University and for whom a major problem is lack of valid information. Our idea helps them to navigate and know the on-ground variables related to particular universities. The application provides the essential features required for any student who is relocating from different state or country by providing him/her a single platform to gain information onto many on-site requirements such as a forum to speak with the current students enrolled into the Syracuse university regarding numerous topics, information regarding housing and locomotion, The university’s events and sports, places to visit around and a market place to buy or sell something among the peers. The application provides an image of Syracuse university culture and environment and acts as a ground for students to find friends with common interests and clear doubts on many miscellaneous topic. The application tends to target students who are willing or are joining Syracuse university.

# Project Scope:
This project will consist of creating a web application platform that can be used to help prospective students, current students and also the alumni of the university to get information regarding their favorite school/city. The crux of the application will be divided into 2 parts: Information seekers and providers. The first part of the product deals with any user visiting our website and absorbing the information that is already there where as the second part of the project deals with giving the user the right to ask questions and also to answer them, at the same time they can also interact with other parts of the website we are planning.

To gain access to edit and add the information to the website, Users can create their own profile. Once the information is validated the users can go ahead and user our website to its fullest. The users are validated by sending an OTP to their University email ID.

The SU Forum aspect of the project is similar to a group chat. Users are given the opportunity to filter the topic that concerns them to get the information required.
Few of the filters we are planning to provide in the project are: Academics, On-campus Jobs, Housing, Graduate/Undergraduate, Entertainment, and Miscellaneous. Only the registered users can post and answer the queries in the forum.

SU Housing deals with providing access to the off-campus landlords in Syracuse to post advertisements about any lease/sub-lease. The module provides features such as uploading the images, information about the rent and house agreement and also provide contact info.

SU Marketplace provides the student/faculty/staff to buy/sell/exchange products with each other. The module also provides features similar to that of SU Housing module. In addition to that, we will also provide the party involved to chat in the application.

# Future functionality: 

In future we are planning to add many more modules like:

•	Data Analysis on how things can be improved based on the inputs already available. 
•	Module which allows students to post their on-campus job shifts.
•	Separate channels for alumni, current students and prospective students with restricted access.
•	Module where students can share their tour guides and media.
•	Separate forums based on the department and course.
•	Feature for users within the channel to directly message other users.
